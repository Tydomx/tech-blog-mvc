## Project Description: 

The application is a CMS-style blog website that allows the user to publish articles, blog posts, thoughts and opinions. The app follows the MVC paradigm for the file structure, uses Handlebar as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM and express-session npm package for authentication.

---
## Dependencies:
#### Back-End
* Sequelize	
* bcrypt
* dotenv
* mysql2
* jest
* nodemon
#### Front-end
* connect-session-sequelize
* express
* express-handlebars
* express-session

### Some issues with the app:
Currently the comment section is not being registered into the database. As well as not showing onto the post after commenting.
### Future features to hopefully implement:
* Allowing users to add a profile picture and profile information on the profile page.

## Deployed
The app is deployed at: [Tech Blog MVC](https://tech-blog-mvcz.herokuapp.com/)
