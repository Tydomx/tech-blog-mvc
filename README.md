## Project Description: 
### The application is a CMS-style blog website that allows the user to publish articles, blog posts, thoughts and opinions. The technologies used to create the app: 
#### Back-End
* Sequelize	
* bcrypt
* dotenv
* mysql2
* jest
* nodemon
#### Front-end
* connect-session-sequelize
* express
* express-handlebars
* express-session

### Some issues with the app:
Currently the comment section is not being registered into the database. As well as not showing onto the post after commenting.
### Future features to hopefully implement:
* Allowing users to add a profile picture and profile information on the profile page.

## Installation:
### Run the following command for this app to start:
	npm install
### After cloning the app onto your machine. Once the server has started the user will have to update the .env file to be able to access the MySQL from their local machine or the JAWSDB will be used for non-local.
